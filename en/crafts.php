                    <p>
                        I've always shared my do-it-yourself passion with my family, my husband in particular. More than once we happened to be speaking with friends or colleagues about one of the crafts we made, and most of the time we didn't have a photo to show. Several things are on my Instagram profile, but that's far from complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this first need, I had the idea of developing a website about our free-time passion. 
                        <br>Well, since I also have a pasison for <a href="writing.php">writing</a>, I was happy to have a place for my texts, with plenty of topics to cover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We feature news that dive deep into the beghind-the-scenes of our crafts, more than what social media allow. There's a gallery of our works to browse by category or, by time, with details about each single piece. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to tell our crafters' path: new ideas, challenges, errors, tips, successes. There're also tutorials about the techniques we master deeply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have also a few social media to share our content and the making-of live. You can find #LRCrafts on Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and, lastly created but not less important, YouTube.
                    </p>
