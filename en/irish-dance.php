                    <p>
                        My love for Ireland has been with me since I can recall. My family says it was born as a child when I discovered Irish and Scottish traditional music.
                        <br>I think those reels and jigs sound as one with my inner soul.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I had the occasion to move to the Emerald Isle, I got it and prepared my luggages. 
                        <br>I lived and worked in Cork, for some unforgettable months deeply lost in the culture of what has become my second homeland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, those months confirmed that Ireland suits me!
                        <br>My landlord one day said to me "You are more Irish than the Irish themselves!".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here I experienced first hand how warm are Irish, who pass by a stranger along the road and never miss to greet him good day. 
                        <br>A group of elderly locals even <a href="https://rici86.blogspot.com/2014/05/my-search-of-craic.html">welcomed me during a dance night</a>, as I was the daughter of an old friend!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, that night I tried for the first time a dancing with Irish music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always admired the Irish dancers, but I had my occasion to try and be one only getting closer to my thirties.
                        <br>And once I tried, I couldn't quit.
                    </p>

                        <br>and found it in the kind of places we call home.
