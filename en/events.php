                    <p>
                        I could say I began organising events by chance. 
                        <br>The first ones were in 2009: the first concert by my mother and an art exhibition for the Museum for which I became the director the very same year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2012, my first Medieval reenactment. Before that moment, I always attended the Medieval Days of Zavattarello as museum educator. I took part in the event's athmosphere wearing Medieval-like clothes. 
                        <br>But three weeks before the event that year, we had to start anew from the very beginning: I had to reorganise all the shows from scratch. 
                        <br>Since I have several friends and acquaintances in reenactment groups, I was able to find reenactors willing to participate and we saved the event.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was the beginning of my passion for events organisation.
                        <br>I've been planning, organising, coordinating the shows for the Medieval Days up to 2019. It was one of the hardest and most tiring events, but full of satisfactions.
                        <br>Our family also has a passion for reenactment, so my kins were happy to be part of the event. We both improved our historical accuracy as reenactors and offered to the audience an event that gained more and more praise.
